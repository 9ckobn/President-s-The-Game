  Texts:
  - Each card has its own unique effect.
  - If you get confused, just point your cursor at it.
  - Try to attack the factor.
  - But don't mindlessly cast cards, you're not playing some minigame, here the fate
    of the world is decided.
  - Every card goes to cooldown after casting. It will always last 3 rounds, so think
    ahead!
  - And don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's actions.
